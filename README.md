# ShipNet-Ship-Detection-in-Satellite-Images-

This project implements a ship detection system using a combination of a classification model and a sliding window technique. The dataset is divided into two parts:

1- Training Data: Used to train the classification model.
2- Scene Data: Satellite images of port areas containing ships for the detection task.
For the classification phase, we trained a MobileNet model, chosen for its lightweight architecture and ability to deliver strong performance with high efficiency.
